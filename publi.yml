  title: A theory for species co-occurrence in interaction networks
  container-title: Theoretical Ecology
  page: '39-48'
  volume: '9'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: 'The study of species co-occurrences has been central in community ecology
    since the foundation of the discipline. Co-occurrence data are, nevertheless,
    a neglected source of information to model species distributions and biogeographers
    are still debating about the impact of biotic interactions on species distributions
    across geographical scales. We argue that a theory of species co-occurrence in
    ecological networks is needed to better inform interpretation of co-occurrence
    data, to formulate hypotheses for different community assembly mechanisms, and
    to extend the analysis of species distributions currently focused on the relationship
    between occurrences and abiotic factors. The main objective of this paper is to
    provide the first building blocks of a general theory for species co-occurrences.
    We formalize the problem with definitions of the different probabilities that
    are studied in the context of co-occurrence analyses. We analyze three species
    interactions modules and conduct multi-species simulations in order to document
    five principles influencing the associations between species within an ecological
    network: (i) direct interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (ii) indirect
    interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (iii) pairwise co-occurrence rarely
    are symmetric, (iv) the strength of an association decreases with the length of
    the shortest path between two species, and (v) the strength of an association
    decreases with the number of interactions a species is experiencing. Our analyses
    reveal the difficulty of the interpretation of species interactions from co-occurrence
    data. We discuss whether the inference of the structure of interaction networks
    is feasible from co-occurrence data. We also argue that species distributions
    models could benefit from incorporating conditional probabilities of interactions
    within the models as an attempt to take into account the contribution of biotic
    interactions to shaping individual distributions of species.'

  abstract: The role of fungi in soil ecosystem sustainability is poorly understood,
    as is the extent to which it is affected by the microscale heterogeneity of soils
    with respect to structure, chemistry and biology. This is due to the complexity
    of soil ecosystems, presenting significant challenges to their study in situ.
    Many theoretical and simulation models have been developed to link nutrient levels
    to colony dynamics. Unfortunately, there is currently no model that can take both
    structural and nutritional microscale heterogeneity into account, and is parameterised
    for the soil environment. In this context, the objective of this article is to
    develop such a 3D spatially explicit model of fungal dynamics, and to calibrate
    it for a soil system using data from the literature. A sensitivity analysis is
    carried out to better understand the uncertainties in the input parameters and
    their effect on colony dynamics in terms of biomass yield and respiration rates.
    The results highlight simulation outcomes that are most suited to validation by
    experimentation. The results also indicate that predictions in biomass yield are
    sensitive to uncertainties in model parameters relative to the soil-fungal complex
    that at this point are insufficiently understood experimentally and still have
    to be estimated by model fitting. The latter parameters, which influence biomass
    yield and respiration, are associated with biomass recycling processes such as
    adsorption (,??ni) desorption (??ni, ??i), insulation (??ni) and biomass yield
    efficiency (e{open}1), and translocation (Dv). The model now opens up great opportunities
    for hypothesis-driven research, combining theoretical models and novel types of
    experimentation, especially given the recently acquired ability to generate artificial,
    replicable soil-like microcosms on which to test model predictions. ?? 2012 Elsevier
