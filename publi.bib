abstract = {The study of species co-occurrences has been central in community ecology since the foundation of the discipline. Co-occurrence data are, nevertheless, a neglected source of information to model species distributions and biogeographers are still debating about the impact of biotic interactions on species distributions across geographical scales. We argue that a theory of species co-occurrence in ecological networks is needed to better inform interpretation of co-occurrence data, to formulate hypotheses for different community assembly mechanisms, and to extend the analysis of species distributions currently focused on the relationship between occurrences and abiotic factors. The main objective of this paper is to provide the first building blocks of a general theory for species co-occurrences. We formalize the problem with definitions of the different probabilities that are studied in the context of co-occurrence analyses. We analyze three species interactions modules and conduct multi-species simulations in order to document five principles influencing the associations between species within an ecological network: (i) direct interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (ii) indirect interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (iii) pairwise co-occurrence rarely are symmetric, (iv) the strength of an association decreases with the length of the shortest path between two species, and (v) the strength of an association decreases with the number of interactions a species is experiencing. Our analyses reveal the difficulty of the interpretation of species interactions from co-occurrence data. We discuss whether the inference of the structure of interaction networks is feasible from co-occurrence data. We also argue that species distributions models could benefit from incorporating conditional probabilities of interactions within the models as an attempt to take into account the contribution of biotic interactions to shaping individual distributions of species.},

@article{Cazelles2013,
abstract = {The role of fungi in soil ecosystem sustainability is poorly understood, as is the extent to which it is affected by the microscale heterogeneity of soils with respect to structure, chemistry and biology. This is due to the complexity of soil ecosystems, presenting significant challenges to their study in situ. Many theoretical and simulation models have been developed to link nutrient levels to colony dynamics. Unfortunately, there is currently no model that can take both structural and nutritional microscale heterogeneity into account, and is parameterised for the soil environment. In this context, the objective of this article is to develop such a 3D spatially explicit model of fungal dynamics, and to calibrate it for a soil system using data from the literature. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to better understand the uncertainties in the input parameters and their effect on colony dynamics in terms of biomass yield and respiration rates. The results highlight simulation outcomes that are most suited to validation by experimentation. The results also indicate that predictions in biomass yield are sensitive to uncertainties in model parameters relative to the soil-fungal complex that at this point are insufficiently understood experimentally and still have to be estimated by model fitting. The latter parameters, which influence biomass yield and respiration, are associated with biomass recycling processes such as adsorption (,??ni) desorption (??ni, ??i), insulation (??ni) and biomass yield efficiency (e{\{}open{\}}1), and translocation (Dv). The model now opens up great opportunities for hypothesis-driven research, combining theoretical models and novel types of experimentation, especially given the recently acquired ability to generate artificial, replicable soil-like microcosms on which to test model predictions. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},
