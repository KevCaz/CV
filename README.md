# CV_latex

This is my Curriculum Vitae I created using XeLaTex, I was strongly inspired by what [SteveViss](https://github.com/SteveViss) did (see these [files](https://github.com/SteveViss/steveviss.github.com/tree/dev/public/_cv) from the sources of his website).

Regarding the icons inserted in the CV, I used the [fontawesome-latex](https://github.com/xdanaux/fontawesome-latex) package kindly made available by [xdanaux](https://github.com/xdanaux).

Hope this could help.
