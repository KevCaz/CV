# CV_latex

This is my Curriculum Vitae created with XeLaTex. I was strongly inspired by
what [SteveViss](https://github.com/SteveViss) did (see these [files](https://github.com/SteveViss/steveviss.github.com/tree/dev/public/_cv)
from the sources of his website).

Note that I use Font Awesome's icons in my CV (to improve the visual grepping!)
via the [fontawesome5 Latex :package:](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome5).
For the records, I previously used the
[fontawesome-latex](https://github.com/xdanaux/fontawesome-latex) :package:.
