# CV_latex

This is my Curriculum Vitae created with XeLaTex. I was strongly inspired by
what [SteveViss](https://github.com/SteveViss) did (see these [files](https://github.com/SteveViss/steveviss.github.com/tree/dev/public/_cv)
from the sources of his website).

To add some useful icons in the CV (it improves the visual grepping for sure),
I used the [fontawesome-latex](https://github.com/xdanaux/fontawesome-latex)
package kindly made available by [xdanaux](https://github.com/xdanaux).
