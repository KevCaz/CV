# CV_latex

This is my Curriculum Vitae created with XeLaTex. I was strongly inspired by
what [SteveViss](https://github.com/SteveViss) did (see these [files](https://github.com/SteveViss/steveviss.github.com/tree/dev/public/_cv)
from the sources of his website).

To add some icons in the CV (they do improve the visual grepping!),
I used the [fontawesome-latex](https://github.com/xdanaux/fontawesome-latex)
package maintained on Github [xdanaux](https://github.com/xdanaux)
and available in the package [texlive-font-extra](https://packages.debian.org/fr/stretch/texlive-fonts-extra) on
Debian 9 (Stretch) and higher:

```
apt-get install texlive-font-extra
```

on MacOS, the package is included in the [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)
distribution.

```
brew cask install mactex
```
